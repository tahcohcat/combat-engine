## Some ideas


### Character Cards


     (cost: may be several different resource types needed ?)

    ---------------------------------
    | 4 gold   |     Spider         |  <-- character type descrtion
    |-------------------------------|
    | venom, stealth                |  <-- tags [optional]: these are not guaranteed
    |-------------------------------|      for every spider but may or may not be there.
    |       |              |        |      depends on luck. card's cost may be increased
    |       |              |        |      with number of tags to keep things balanced.

    |       |              |        |  <-- support connect [optional]: some cards will have
    |       |              |        |      one or both these arrows in a specific tribe colour
    |-------------------------------|      indicating who they can be linked to.          
    |            stats              |
    |                               |
    | health           : 100        |
    | regular damage   :  50        |
    | magic damage     :  30        |
    | attack speed     : 0.5 s      |
    | ability cooldown : 1.2 s      |    
    |-------------------------------|
    |            tribe              |
    |-------------------------------|
    |  river, woods                 |  <-- zone synergy [options] unlocks the units' special ability
    |                               |      unit can be played anywhere but will only have the special
    |-------------------------------|      ability if it is in the correct zone.  
    |            *  *  *            |  <-- genetic rating
    ---------------------------------

    card linking:
    
    cards of different tribes can be linked:
    ------------------------------------------------------
    linked cards are typically stronger and can accumulate
    generic bonuses for a specific number of cards linked
    
    for example:
    
    2 linked cards in RED zone get buff RED-BUFF-LEVEL-1 
    3 linked cards in RED zone get buff RED-BUFF-LEVEL-2
    4 linked cards in RED zone get buff RED-BUFF-LEVEL-3
        
    
## Board
 
 3 zones for each player. these will be randomly assigned at the start of a game (?)
