A fun way to learn about go routines...


The idea is to create a number of different types of characters, with certain characteristic tags and tribes.

They will have standard stats but will have slightly different genetics and stats variations.

There will be a market where players can spend resources to pick more characters to add to their existing pool.

Any unpicked characters will be moved to the player on the left such that each player will receive the remaining sets etc. 



# Ideas

ResLight, ResDark - modifies goodness of player - either could be a requirement for some characters to either be player or be enhanced. 
Seems better to make it an default attribute of each character : Good, Bad, Neutral. Can also be used to create some assymetric game effects.
